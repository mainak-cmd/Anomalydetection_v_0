Develop an end-to-end algorithm from scratch to detect anomalies in a semi-supervised manner. Train the model separately on anomaly and normal data to establish their respective ranges. Evaluate the likelihood of anomalies in new data by comparing it against these established ranges. Continuously monitor the modelâ€™s performance and retrain it as needed for improved accuracy.
Download the data from datasetlink.md and place it in the anomolaydetection folder. Ensure to preprocess the data before feeding it into the algorithm.
